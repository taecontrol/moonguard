## How MoonGuard Filament Plugin works

MoonGuard helps you monitor the status, performance and SSL certificate status of your websites. To use MoonGuard, you need to deploy it and add some sites. If you also want to collect health data or exceptions from your sites, you need to install [Larvis](https://github.com/taecontrol/larvis) in your site's project.

Larvis is a lightweight package that integrates with the MoonGuard ecosystem. It sends data to your MoonGuard system or the Krater desktop app. Larvis is designed to work seamlessly with MoonGuard and enhance its functionality.
