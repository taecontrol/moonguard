## About MoonGuard Filament Plugin

MoonGuard is a **Filament plugin** that provides you with tools to track the status, performance, health and crashes of multiple Laravel apps in production. MoonGuard is designed to work seamlessly with Laravel applications and gives you the flexibility to customize it according to your needs.

MoonGuard Filament Plugin aims to be the free open source alternative for monitoring production site's health.

For more information about MoonGuard Filament Plugin and its features, please visit our [official site](https://moonguard.dev/filament-plugin).

We prepared a demo for MoonGuard, you can access the demo [here](https://moonguard.dev/moonguard).

## How MoonGuard Filament Plugin works

MoonGuard helps you monitor the status, performance and SSL certificate status of your websites. To use MoonGuard, you need to deploy it and add some sites. If you also want to collect server health data or exceptions from your sites, you need to install [Larvis](https://github.com/taecontrol/larvis) in your site's project.

Larvis is a lightweight package that integrates with the MoonGuard ecosystem. First, it has to be installed in your site's project, and then it has to be configured to send data to your MoonGuard system through HTTP requests. Larvis can send data to your MoonGuard system or the Krater desktop app. 

Larvis is designed to work seamlessly with MoonGuard to enhance its functionality.

## Documentation
